# CRC-Microbiome-Classification

# The First International FeatureCloud Hackathon
20 - 24.06.2022, Hamburg, University of Hamburg, Institute for Computational Systems Biology

# The microbiome challenge:

## Data:
Shotgun metagenome data of gut microbiomes from ca. 1,400 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients acquired from ten distributed hospitals

## Goal: 
Prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) phenotype (CRC, adenoma, healthy), and sub-phenotypes (e.g. CRC stage)

## Additional difficulty: 
Unbalanced class distribution, unbalanced features (e.g. gender, age), hidden confounders (we will simulate this with known features, e.g. age or BMI)

## Overall objective: 
A federated predictor of CRC (subtypes) from gut microbiome data

## Validation: 
Method performance will be compared to that of the standard centralized approach and will be validated by the organization team using new, unseen data
